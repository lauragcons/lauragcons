- 👋 Hi, I’m @lauragcons, an Industrial Designer!
- 👀 I’m interested in learn Data Analysis and create amazing data visualizations!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Excel, MySQL and Phyton.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to lifestyle, education and personal growth.
- 📫 How to reach me: Want to talk with me? Contact me at lauragconsuegra@gmail.com
- 💜 Pronouns: She/Her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I worked in UX but I figured out it doesn't like me like Data Analysis and visualization do.
That's why I want to use all my knowledge in Design to create the best way to show data for all the people ✨✨✨
